# PI IN THE SKY

## Planning

### Goal

The goal of this project is in the name. We want to get our Raspberry Pi in the air. We can get it there in any fashion we want but it has to specifically do a couple things: Collect acceleration during its flight, and know when its at the top of its flight. Besides that though, it's completely open-ended, and we can take this in any direction we want. We are hoping we can make something pretty coool.

### Resources and Constraints

We have the entire sigma lab at our disposal on this one. While we will likely need to use a variety of different things, it's important that we don't simply waste materials as a lot of the stuff in here is pretty expensive. We want to make this as efficient as possible. The other big constraint is time. Although it seems like we have a lot of time, it's going to fly by, and if we aren't careful, we won't get much accomplished.

#### Materials

* Proper plastic bottles
* Polyurethane based adhesive
* Sand paper
* Knife
* Carbon Fiber or Fiber Glass
* Plastic gloves
* Some type of resin
* Tommy timer
* Parachute
* 8mm Plywood
* Assortment of pipe parts
* Spray paint (optional)
* Hose
* Air pump (of some sort)

### Brainstorming

* Rocket :kissing:
* Hang Glider :smirk:
* Kite :confused:
* Cannon :angry:

### Solution

We decided to go with the rocket. After much debate and research, we came to the conclusion that the rocket project would provide just the right amount of ambition and doability. We had a little hesitancy simply because it was a popular choice among the other groups, but we are going to strive to make the best possible rocket while also being able to record accurate results.

### Initial Design

### Milestone Schedule

* 3/15/19: By the end of our first week, we will have made a decision on what we're going to do. We need to weigh a lot of options and pick something that is both ambitious and realistic.
* 3/22/19: We will have finished our initial planning, and we will have a solid design of what we want our product to look like. 
* 3/29/19: We will have carefully selected the appropriate material that we want our rocket to be made out of, and we will have some progress going with the actual design of the thing.
* 4/12/19: This week will be spent continung our design in Solidworks, and we should also have some progress on the Pi coding part.
* 4/19/19: Now that we have adjusted our ideas a bit, we will need some more time. At this point, we should putting together a prototype.
* 4/26/19: We may have to go out and buy some bottles to make the prototype.
* 4/3/19: We should be designing some new and refined parts in Solidworks and maybe getting a print or two in.
* 5/10/19: Time to start putting together the prototype. As of now we are not sure we will include the parachute or not.
* 5/17/19: Testing week for the prototype. Once this is done we can start on the real thing.
* 5/24/19: We will be putting together the final rocket and we writing the code for the pi. This will be after senior release, so we will be pretty much spending our entire day in the Sigma Lab.
* 5/31/19: We will successfully launch our beautiful rocket, and of course there will be no problems, and our pi will record some flawless flight data. Then, we will finish up the documentation. DONE WITH SCHOOL.

### Revised Solution

So we're gonna really amp it up. We figured that because this will be our last project at CHS, we want to make it special. We decided to turn this into a water rocket capable of flying pretty darn high. It's gonna take a lot of work and a ton of precision but we want to be ambitious and go for it. We are also planning on doing all of the designing before the actual coding. We want to have a fully functional rocket before the code and pi are involved to ensure the safety of the pi.

## Building Time

### Launching

Lucky enough for us, people had already made a rocket launch stand that we could use, however, we made a few edits of our own to make things easier on ourselves. We figured there had to be a way to launch the rocket without being directly under the rocket during blast off. So, we got a super long piece of string and used it like the reins for horses. We attached it to the quick release hose adapter ![Quick Release](https://github.com/amorela10/Pi_in_the_Sky/blob/master/IMG_0272%5B1%5D.JPG) and then drilled in a U-shaped piece out of PVC. The point of this piece was to have the string run through it so that at longer distances from the launch system, the string would be able to pull down on of the quick release. 

![String thing](https://github.com/amorela10/Pi_in_the_Sky/blob/master/IMG_0273%5B1%5D.JPG)

In addition to this, we wanted to make sure our rocket went straight up rather than launching to the side or at any harsh angles. This led us to think about NASA launching rockets, which made us think of the things on the side which help guide the rocket. So, we used three different wooden poles (sharpened at the ends to stick into the ground). We drilled holes in the side of those poles at a decent height that would line up with the bottle. In those holes, we put small chop-stickm things through it with bent pieces of cardboard stuck to the end, uniform with the outer edge of the bottle. Pushing and pulling the chop sticks made them adjustable so they could directly touch the rocket no matter the rocket's varying distance from the poles position in the ground.

### Mark I

 So, our first prototype was given the name Mark I, inspired by the GOAT Tony Stark. First, we did lots of research regarding local bottles to use. We ended up settling for a sparkling water at a local Walmart, which happened to also taste very good. Once we got the bottles in the lab, we got started on working. We cut the bottles according to our plan. One was cut on both sides, while the other to still had the bottle cap attached. We then used a bowl to hold water whiched we microwaved to a temperature that was hot enough to shrink the plastic. The idea was to shrink one side of the plastic to slot it into the other bottle, and then glue the joints together, and then tape. We executed this almost perfectly, except for one end of the bottle which we shrunk a bit too much so it had some irregularities. ![curdled bottle](https://github.com/amorela10/Pi_in_the_Sky/blob/master/IMG_0140%5B1%5D.JPG). The adhesive we used to glue the joints together was a Gorilla Glue Epoxy. After applying it to our rocket, not without getting it stuck on ourselves, we let it dry for 24 hours. Then the two of us went our separate ways on Solidworks: Joe worked on a cap for the rocket, while I designed the fins.
 
 The idea for the cap was that a pole would be attached to the cap that would fit snugly through the bottle neck. We got the snug fit right on the first try, however this cap would become our downfall eventually. For the fins, I looks at different fin designs. I noticed that for larger rockets, longer, shorter fins worked better, and for smaller rockets, smaller fins that extruded more from the rocket worked best. So, since ours is on the relatively smaller side, we decided to go with the smaller fins that extruded more from the bottle. It was at this point in the process that we made our first real mistake, gluing the fins on before you are finished with everything else. When your fins are made of balsa wood, they become very easy to break. And so break they did. We even broke one of the fins in two different places.
 
 One day, while we were strolling around with our rocket, Mr. H walked up to us asking about the rocket. He pointed our one glaring proble  with the rocket, with all of that air pressure built up, the cap of our rocket would just pop off like some sort of cannon. Because of this, we decided it would be best to break out the epoxy again, this time for the cap. We lathered the rod and the inside of the bottle opening with epoxy and then squeezed them together.
 
 Now it was time for the tape job. We wrapped a couple layers of duct tape around the joints where we had already used epoxy. Then, for extra security, and looks, we wrapped the nose, or cap, of our rocket with electrical tape. Once finished with the important tape job, we branded the side of it with its name: Mark I.
 
 Earlier on in the process, Karl also introduced us to the rocket box, along with other equipment in the back room. This had a bunch of different equipment that is very useful for launching a rocket. For instance, a hose clamp to tighten the nossle(another thing found in the magic box) and a quick release hose adapter. We didn't end up using the nossle and instead bought two of our own that better fit over the actual bottle cap.

### Ark II

You may have noticed that the number went up one and we lost a letter. Well this wasn't really planned. We accidentally covered up the letter M when giving it more duct tape, so we improvised and decided that we would take off a letter and add a number for each rocket. The only real difference on this model was that added a bottom-up bottle to the top instead of the original nose. We glued this on, and although it wasn't pretty, we rrally just wanted to get something in the air.

![ArkII](https://github.com/amorela10/Pi_in_the_Sky/blob/master/IMG_0276%5B1%5D.JPG)

We used epoxy as the adhesive, but since we wanted to get moving along with the next portion of the project, we decided to only let it dry for a few hours instead of the recommended 24 for a full cure. This probably wasn't all that beneficial, as once we got to 50 psi on our pressure test, our new bottle became detached. So, after several glue jobs and many problems we didn't get to launch anything and got up to a measly 50 psi for out prototype. But hey, it was a prototype so we felt that with our lessons learned we could build a better final rocket. 

### Rk III

Same idea here, we cut up four bottles, heated up the ends, sanded them and put them together. However, instead of using the epoxy, this time, we used a polyurethane based adhesive. This was believed to be some more heavy duty stuff, as it's pretty much just just rubber glue. Only not so fun part about it was that it takes a week to fully cure. While we didn't have the time to let it sit a whole week, we were able to, with the help of memorial day weekend, give it a good five days to form a bond. 

So when, we came back we went straight to the pressure test. All was going well, but at around 65 psi, a big boom happened and on of the seals broke. This was pretty sucky, because it meant we were not going to be able to launch a full blown rocket simply because we didn't have the time to let more glue dry. Poor Rk III... such a short life.

### K IV

This turned out to be a true masterpiece. Composed of only one pressureized bottle, it would take a lot to screw this one up. No bonds, no noses, just one cylider of plastic holding it all in. On tip of that we used duct tape to attach a compartment for the pi. This was actually larger than the pressurize portion, which probably was not all that good for balance in the air, but at this point we didn't really care. We just wanted something to fly in the air.

We cut open a little slot in the top compartment so that we could plug in the battery when the time came, and the plan would just be to duct tape it shut once everything was in. Again, not all that pretty, but it worked to a degree. On the first launch we got up to 60 psi and were pleasantly suprised with its rather clean flight as it went maybe 60-80 feet in the air. Yay. Something in the air. Unfortunately, no data was recorded so we had to give it another go. The second launch got up to 80 psi and and probably went about the same height as the first with a much less stable flight path. But, we got data, so that's all that mattered.

## CODE

## Problems

* 3D printed plastic is apparently not air tight. In the consturcution of Mark I, it seemed that everything was going well. While we knew that air is a nasty litte thing, we were thinking that any errors would be a result of the epoxy not being strong enough. It had not even entered our brains that 3D printed material might not be a good thing for keeping in air. If only we had thought of that.
* It's probably best to let an adhesive do its thing for the recommended time for it to fully cure. It was clear that epoxy after four hours was not as strong as epoxy after 24 hours. While it's unclear if only letting the polyurethane set for five days had a real impact on the ouctome, it certainly would not have hurt to let it sit for another two days.
* Again, while we are not exactly sure of its impact, the polyurethane we used was not specifically meant for bonding plastic, as it was designated "roof and flashing". It's hard to imagine that polyurethane meant for plastic would not have done considerably better in keeping in air.
* Air likes to be sneaky. It's best to do literally everything in your power to secure a bond, possible leak before testing it against the evil wrath of air.
* The code. OMG the code. We had a stumper of an issue here. While when plugged into the computer, our pi would flawlessly record and store height data into a file, as soon as we used battery power, it would make the file but leave it blank. We tried about 100 different things for this and none of them seemed to work. Some of our ideas were using rc local instead of bash rc, using a startup file , and a billion other things. In the end, the magic touch was simply Dr. Shields accessing our pi remotely from his phone after it recorded data. For some reason, him looking at it from his phone made the pi seem to remember what it just did and keep the data in the file. Then we could go back into the computer and see what was recorded. This is what we were finally able to do on our last launch, and thankfully, after a scare resulting from misleading times, we got data from our flight.
